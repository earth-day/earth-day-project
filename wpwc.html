    <div class="text4">Due to many problems such as pollution, global warming and deforestation, our Earth is suffering. Earth Day helps us understand these problems and motivates us to protect our Earth from further damage and danger. Long-distance runs are organised and local governments host a variety of events focusing on the importance of Earth Day and the need to protect the environment. Even a small action like turning off the lights in our home for an hour has a big impact. It's our home, our planet, and we need to fix the damage we have caused.</div>
