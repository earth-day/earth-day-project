    <div class="text4">An U.S senator named Gayford Nelson senator created the World Earth Day in 22 April 1970 to support the planet's wellbeing and raise public awareness of the issue. Our world is a great place, but it requires our protection to thrive. This day has been observed in more than 193 nations since 1970 to promote environmental protection. World Earth Day is celebrated around the world to raise awareness of ever-increasing global warming. Earth Day is celebrated to honour our Earth and raise awareness of the need to protect it. </div>
